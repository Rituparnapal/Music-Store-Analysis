# Music-Store-Analysis

The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the data related to customers, sales, music preferences, and artist performance. By answering a series of progressively complex questions—ranging from basic queries to advanced data aggregations—the project seeks to:

  1. Identify key business metrics such as top-performing employees, cities, and customers.
  2. Understand customer behavior and preferences, particularly in relation to music genres and artists.
  3. Discover trends in sales and invoice data across different countries and cities.
  4. Support business decisions such as promotional event planning and targeted marketing based on data-driven insights.
